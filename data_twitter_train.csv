For those unaware, Southern Seminary president Al Mohler was recently seated at a panel hosted by the Kenwood Institute. The topics covered contentious issues in SBC life, including the abuse and financial crises, along with the issue of women serving in ministry and how it relates to the proposed Law Amendment.

When asked by discussion moderators and CBMW members Colin Smothers and Denny Burk about the role of women pastors in SBC churches, Mohler would suggest, The idea that you would have the word pastor applied to a woman in the Southern Baptist Conventionto the vast majority of Southern Baptists, I don't think has ever made sense.

This framing is disingenuous. 

Perhaps the issue here is that what does not make sense to white males in the seat of denominational power with ties to an institution founded upon slave-holding theology makes perfect sense to minorities. 

What does not make sense to men who refuse to see the Bibles ringing endorsement of women using their gifts in the church under the leadership and watchful care and protection of their senior pastor makes perfect sense to those who know what it is to be denied a role in the life of the church because of something they cannot control, regardless if it is skin color or gender.

What does not make sense to the majority to which Mohler claims to belong seems to make perfect sense to countless Southern Baptist pastors, professors, and minorities, including Asian and African Americans.

After the disfellowshipping of Rick Warren and Saddleback, the National African American Fellowship, SBC (NAAF) penned a letter to SBC President Bart Barber outlining the widespread concern many predominantly African American churches in SBC life have with this new threat of creedalism and autonomy infringement. This letter was not coming from the fringe of SBC life, either, as NAAF has nearly 4,000 churches and its letter outlining concerns with the Law Amendment was endorsed by former SBC President J.D. Greear.

Many of the 4,000 churches affiliated with NAAF unashamedly hold to the conservative, BFM-compatible, and biblical opinion that women may be freed up to serve in the local church in shepherding ministries under the authority of a male senior pastor who has been duly credentialed, called, and installed by the congregation. This female-empowering, congregational, and softly complementarian position has persisted in SBC life without controversy until recently.

Would Al Mohler dare suggest the positions of the pastors of these 4,000 churches dont make sense? It is likely he would not, but that did not stop him from taking a cheap shot from the insular, predominantly male, White, and Calvinist fortress that is Southern Seminary.

But African Americans are not the only group profoundly affected by the threat of creedalism and autonomy infringement. Other minority groups in SBC life have vested interests in these debates.

The Chinese Baptist Fellowship (CBF) put out an open letter that received coverage in Baptist Press and the prestigious evangelical publication Christianity Today. 

In that letter, Chinese Baptist leaders shared that women have held a vital role in the Chinese church. They noted their culture, history, and language carry a range of words for women in ministry, which include the following words: minister, teacher, evangelist, and Bible woman. 

The CBF said that because it is now the practice of some churches to give the title pastor to non-ordained church staff, any of these Chinese words may also be faithfully translated as pastor.

There are historical and cultural elements to this decision in staff titles among Chinese churches, too:

Due to persecution and a lack of mature male leaders, women played a pivotal role in evangelism, teaching, and discipleship. This still takes place today within the Chinese church in China and among the Chinese Diaspora including North America with women having shepherding roles and caring responsibilities for womens, children and youth, administrative, and other ministries under the male leadership of a senior pastor.

Like NAAF, the CBF also expressed concern over the threat of church autonomy being violated by anti-women creedalism and misunderstandings from translating Chinese words into English, yet Al Mohler would also have us believe the position, cultural heritage, language, and history of the CBF doesnt make sense.

Mohler was later asked how he would respond to the charge that what Law Amendment proponent call a more robust confessionalism (by which is meant a strict policing and shunning of churches who have women serving on staff in pastoral roles, but subordinate to a male senior pastor) could potentially violate the tried-and-true Baptist principle of local church autonomy. 

Mohler derisively and divisively replied: Okay, now that is the most ridiculous statement. Mohler then joked with the moderator, I put up with all the nonsense you said up front so far.

Al Mohlers condescending and cavalier attitude to those who have rightly expressed concern over churches acting autonomously in their hiring, staffing, and ministry decisions is beneath the dignity of his status as an entity head for several reasons, but not the least of which includes many softly complementarian churches with female pastors under the authority of male senior pastors who are in alignment with the BF&M as adopted in 2000 giving portions of tithes to the Cooperative Program from the hard-earned money of their congregants. Dr. Mohler would do well to remember it is not advisable to disenfranchise or dismiss large sections of his institutions constituency.

Many in SBC life have begun to sound the alarm over an increasingly encroaching threat of creedalism that threatens the autonomy of local churches. Two highly esteemed Southern Baptist professors, Dr. Malcolm Yarnell and Dr. Steve McKinion, recently expressed their worry over this very issue in an editorial for Baptist Press. Here is a relevant passage from that excellent piece:

We believe Baptists must be careful never to fall into the horrific error of state churches who wrongly imposed their confessions on others, including on Baptists. Indeed, Baptist confessionalism ceases to be Baptist when it is used as a weapon against others rather than as an invitation to consider the Good News of Jesus Christ, the great truths of His Word, and the free offer of salvation to all who will believe in and confess Him as their only Lord.

Would Dr. Mohler dare accuse these two highly intelligent men and seasoned SBC statesmen of nonsense? Would he suggest their thoughts dont make sense? I think not.

Dr. Mohlers contempt for those of us who commission women pastors in our autonomous congregations out of reverence for the Scriptures and under the leadership of the Spirit also reeks of a master-slave hierarchy that is unique to the worldview of Southern Seminary. Indeed, by his incendiary remarks, he has effectively dismissed the well-founded concerns of his minority SBC brothers and sisters, if not validated them. 

(He also did this when he refused to outright condemn the notorious Confederate sympathizer, credibly accused predator, and Conservative Resurgence architect Paul Pressler when he came on the cusp of excusing him because Pressler had many enemies.)

How, then, are we to make sense of what Al Mohler claims doesnt make sense to those in his theological tribe? How are we to make sense of his suggestion that women pastors dont make sense and that concerns raised by churches who employ them are nonsense?

I would suggest what is now abundantly clear to anyone with eyes to see that the push from hyper-complementarians to adopt the Law Amendment is nothing less than a concerted effort to cull minority and other women-empowering churches from life in the SBC.

It is true the advocates of the Law Amendment do not want women to have a place as pastors in the SBC. But the same is also true of their contempt for women who serve as children and youth directors, leaders, ministers, teachers, evangelists, and Bible women, likely because they know many of those Bible women threaten their own security and power in the SBC because they run the risk of being out-shepherded, out-preached, and out-Bibled.

If in Gods sovereignty the Law Amendment passes, I believe this would indicate honesty and transparency for the SBCs true anti-women and anti-minority convictions. The lions share of Cornerstones funds is currently distributed to missional and educational causes. The Baptist General Convention of Texas receives a monthly donation from Cornerstone Church, and a modest amount is designated for the CP while were awaiting the final vote on the Law Amendment. 

We will remain contributors to the BGCT as we fully embrace them and their respect for our autonomy, but we will no longer designate even a modest portion to the Cooperative Program if the Law Amendment succeeds. We simply do not have the bandwidth to financially support a funding program that currently has no minority serving as an entity head, nor one that restricts Chinese, African American, and even Anglo-American SBC congregations from following the dictates of their conscience, biblical convictions, and values by recognizing women can receive a pastoral gift from God in partnership with male leadership with affirmation of their gift.

The historic and current posture towards minorities and women in leadership being practiced and canonized in the constitution by virtue of the Law Amendment would be a bridge too far for me to cross. However, if there is a redeeming virtue to the potential passing of the Law amendment, it would be, again, the honesty, transparency, and definitive position it representsone our church would find restrictive, harmful, and unbiblical. 

Should the amendment pass, my sole regret would be the obfuscation in which the architects of the Conservative Resurgence engaged when they had the opportunity to be transparent when the BF&M was revised in 2000. 

Now, churches, women, and minorities will clearly know if they belong in the SBC who dont believe the Law Amendment should be a litmus test of orthodoxy.

Requests from my African American brothers and others who disagree with the Law Amendment to remain in the SBC until this matter reached resolution, is why I have remained thus far. My belief systems and Mohlers belief systems on this matter are irreconcilable. The only difference is, I am not trying to force him out if he does not conform to my viewpoints. But he wants me out if I dont conform to his viewpoints. As is often said in the African American community, make it make sense.",39,40,212,51.6K,72,[],president,1733,0.9963

Jennifer Lind, an American scholar of international relations, has courageously challenged the dominant liberal view in the West that China cannot innovate because of the ""authoritarian"" nature of its political system (""authoritarian"" is a word that Western pundits like to use indiscriminately to refer to political systems that do not follow and/or submit to their Western liberal doxa). This Western liberal theory suggests that China will be unable to escape the ""middle-income trap"" or catch up with the United States economically or militarily.

Yet this view is increasingly refuted by evidence that China has risen in the global innovation ranks. Professor Lind explains China's growing innovation by the fact that the Chinese government is now pursuing policies that encourage innovation. This is an obvious reality for all of us who have been here on the ground in China over the last decade with our eyes and ears wide open. I agree with Professor Lind that, as she says, China's success in innovation has profound implications for the global balance of power.

Now, the contemporary Western liberal view that necessarily links innovation to the liberal political regime was anyway already complete nonsense to anyone who has studied history. As if humanity's innovation had only begun because of the rise of Western liberalism in the second half of the eighteenth century. As if the English Industrial Revolution had no predecessor. 

Well, in fact, it had many precursors, well before the birth of Western liberalism. Take the fourteenth-century innovation revolution in northern Italy that enabled the Renaissance for example. If some degree of liberalism appeared back then, it was not as a cause but rather as a consequence of innovation and economic expansion!

And coming back to China, another American academic, Chinese economic history expert late Robert Hartwell, demonstrated that China experienced an innovation revolution during the Song Dynasty that resulted in a phenomenal industrial revolution... long before the English Industrial Revolution. Lets emphasize that The Song Dynasty was not governed by liberal institutions or anything close to Western liberal democracy, far from it.

Therefore, it is time for Western liberal intellectuals to break out of their ideological solipsism and focus on the facts in order to describe rather than distort the world's reality.",27,97,328,24.4K,53,['https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GGIFW4sW4AAKSxp?format=jpg&name=900x900'],international relations,395,0.9758

2024 will be remembered as a year of infamy and disgrace in the otherwise unblemished international relations history of Ethiopia.
 On New Year's Day of 2024, Abiy Ahmed of Ethiopia signed a contentious Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the President of Somaliland, a region internationally recognized as part of the Republic of Somalia. This signing occurred with flagrant disregard for international charters and treaties governing relations between sovereign nations, demonstrating Abiy Ahmed's apparent disregard for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Somalia.
 The Republic of Somalia vehemently condemned this brazen act by the Abiy regime, and the entire international community, without exception, endorsed Somalia's position.
 Ambiguities within the terms of the MOU, coupled with deceptive motives attributed to Abiy Ahmed, a lack of support from the Ethiopian public, a no-nonsense reaction by the Republic of Somalia, the subsequent disapproval of the international community, and the rejection of the agreement by the people of Somaliland and its parliament led to the effective nullification of the MOU. However, reports surfaced indicating that high-ranking members of the Ethiopian military, including General Getachew Gudina, General Solomon, and others, had recently clandestinely travelled to Somaliland for secret meetings with its President. Additionally, it was revealed that the President of Somaliland had visited Ethiopia a few days earlier and met with Abiy Ahmed and his security advisor, Redwan Hussien, at a resort centre in Arba Minch. This information reached President  Hassan Sheikh Mohamud of Somalia before his trip to Ethiopia to attend the 37th AU Summit of African Heads of State.
 Despite the Republic President's outrage at the perceived treachery of the Ethiopian Prime Minister against his country, travelling to Addis to present Somalia's case at the AU summit was an opportunity President Hassan could not miss. On 16/02/24, upon arriving at Bole International Airport, the president was subjected to an orchestrated ceremony where he had to stand on a podium and listen to the national anthem of Ethiopia, a nation actively working to undermine the integrity of his country. Since the visit of the president was not a state visit, the whole ceremony could have been avoided but was  allowed intentionally to take place. Contrary to reports on social media, President Hassan stoically stood on the podium until the Ethiopian anthem concluded, exhibiting dignity in the face of adversity.
 Yesterday, on 17/02/24, President Hassan expressed his dismay at the disrespectful treatment he endured at the hands of Ethiopian authorities during his attendance at the AU meeting, citing restrictions on his movements and impediments to accessing the AU hall.
 The Ethiopian government has categorically denied any wrongdoing.
 Considering the track record of the Ethiopian PM Abiy Ahmed, it would not be beyond him to show flagrant disregard for diplomatic decorum and etiquette and treat President Hassan of Somalia in a manner as reported by the president himself and the media. Without establishing facts, it would not be wrong to conclude that the disrespect Abiy has shown to the nation of Somalia by violating its sovereignty could easily be extended to disrespecting its president. 

Abiy's actions within Ethiopia are reminiscent of those of a gang leader with no regard for rules or respect. This behaviour may likely be mirrored on a larger scale on the international stage as well.",0,226,308,35.5K,28,"['https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GGniSdkXEAA_lQV?format=jpg&name=360x360', 'https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GGniaskWUAA7wXE?format=jpg&name=360x360']",international relations,552,-0.7916

No more bs excuses! The border patrol has already endorsed the bill and we the Americans people are waiting. 

My initial highlights from the border deal.
- No amnesty/legalization of anyone already in the U.S. illegally.
- Funds an increase in ICE detention capacity to approx. 50,000 from the current 34,000.
- At 7 day rolling average of 5,000 encounters per day, or 8,500 encounters in a single day, DHS is *required to shut the border down, and turn away anyone who crosses. No new asylum claims will be allowed and anybody crossing will be removed. Would end the whole idea of ""I made it to U.S, soil, you have to process me."" That would be over, Border Patrol would not process the illegal crosser and they would be removed - no asylum claim permitted, unless its made at a port of entry.

This does not mean 5,000 are ""allowed in"" before this authority kicks in. Single adults would be detained, families would be released via ATD (alternatives to detention), and asylum cases would be fast tracked to months rather than years under a new rapid/expedited expulsion system. Those who fail would be quickly removed from the US. Those who initially pass would be released with work authorization and 90 day supervision until final asylum claim is determined.
- The shut down authority doesn't drop until crossings decrease significantly in the days following the shut down.
- Significantly tougher asylum requirements, and a higher credible fear standard, including three bars to eligibility. 1) Criminal history, 2)
Could they have resettled in another country on the way to the US? 3) Could they have resettled somewhere else in their own country? Just saying you're scared to return home will no longer be enough in initial interview.
- It appears* that the legislation would move asylum claim decisions away from immigration judges, and instead have them be handled by LISCIS",14,24,134,"2,209",0,"['https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GGpRZNCWgAAmc6P?format=jpg&name=small', 'https://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1759308097930113024/img/kaUtlZhDNZKuYJEO.jpg']",The bill passed,325,-0.9555

The bill passed a second reading at the House and was subsequently referred to the Committee on Civil Society Organisations and Development Partners. After a massive protest, the bill died at the committee stage.

However, the bill saw a revival very recently at the House of Representatives following its sponsorship by Hon. Sada Soli. The bill seeks to establish a legislative framework to regulate the activities of NGOs and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in Nigeria. 

The bill has again drawn significant attention and sparked debates regarding its potential impact on freedom of expression and association, as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and also by international human rights standards.

It is worthy of note that the Chief of Staff to the President and former Speaker of Nigerias Legislative House of Assembly, Femi Gbajabiamila, recently clamoured for social media censorship, ascribing it to a menace.

Recall that, in June 2021, the Buhari-led federal government banned Twitter (now known as X), two days after the social media company deleted a controversial tweet by the president. The ban was lifted seven months later.

 The Democratic Party of the 19th century, particularly in the Southern states, did include many proponents of slavery.

 The Ku Klux Klan was founded by former Confederate soldiers. While some were Democrats, it was not an organization ""founded by the Democratic Party.""

 The Civil War was initiated by the secession of Southern states who wished to preserve the institution of slavery, but saying it was started by the Democratic Party as an entity oversimplifies the complex causes of the war.

 The Dred Scott decision, which ruled that slaves were not citizens but property, was indeed upheld by a Supreme Court that included many justices appointed by Democratic presidents.

 The Republican Party of the 19th century, founded on anti-slavery principles, was indeed instrumental in the abolition of slavery.

No matter what Democrats say, the opposite is true, but since they control the lion's share of the media, they can create the truth the way they want, writes the New York Post. After three years of living in President Biden's ""fantasy world,"" the world has finally fallen through the looking glass of ""Alice in Wonderland.""

For example, Vladimir Putin recently said that he prefers Joe Biden to win the 2024 election over Donald Trump, which was immediately proclaimed in America as a psychological operation. However, when in 2016 Putin said that he preferred Trump to Hillary, Putin was taken at his word and for the next 4 years Trump was slandered about being a Russian agent.

But this time, using a technique of reverse psychology, Putin actually means that he prefers Trump because he cannot support Biden - the vain, feckless and stubborn mouthpiece of failed US foreign policy. For those world leaders who want America to fall, Biden is a valuable asset, whether he knows it or not.

US Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas spoke about Joe Biden's health, calling him ""sharp"" and in ""good shape."" He says the current American president is ""demanding, very detail-oriented and focused,"" which is almost as funny as Kamala Harris' claim that everyone who sees her ""comes away fully aware"" of her ability to lead the country. At least there's a funny side to the topsy-turvy world of Democrats.",3,12,59,"6,977",3,['https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GGurUofXgAABxLA?format=jpg&name=small'],Democratic party,256,0.9672

They always stress to me the importance of self-sufficiency and owning land. In the event of another major conflict like WW3, urban residents could face immense challenges in accessing essential resources.

1. Leverage: 
using leverage is key to building wealth, although dangerous if not used properly, but Americans have the option of 10% down, 30 year fixed loans at still very low rates compared to where inflation will be over the next 2-3 decades, just see the CBO's projections. 

2. Taxes:
taxes are one of the single largest wealth destroyers, and I don't want to pay more than I am required. Real Estate gives me the best chance to remove up to 100% of my taxes. If I save $1m in taxes, do I care of the homes value drops by $300k?

3. Inflation: 
the Gov wants inflation because it ""inflates away their debt"" guess what? it also inflates away our debt. Making the $500k home today worth $100k in 30yr from now dollars

4. Cash Flow: 
the ability to capitalize on the 3 above, while having money going in my pocket each month and someone else paying the loan for me, gives me options not found anywhere else.

-Consumer sentiment has jumped in the last two months at the highest rate since 1991.
 
-Inflation worries are at their lowest since 2021.

-The jobless rate is as its lowest level since the 1960s.

-When accounting for inflation, wages are 3% higher than they were before the killer pandemic, and rising fast.

-New bridges (pictured) are literally being built and replaced by American labor in Red and Blue States all over this country thanks to the historic Infrastructure Bill Joe Biden passed that his idiotic, orange, loser opponent only endlessly talked about for four years. Thousand and thousands of good-paying jobs will result, and it is only getting started.

-Speaking of bridges, the GOP is being ordered to sabotage a bipartisan agreement to fix border issues by the orange, sexual deviant thug who just lost an $83.3M settlement, and knows the only way to avoid jail because of the 91 felony counts against him is to somehow win the presidency and incinerate our Democracy.

-The GOP continues to double-down on stripping women of their healthcare rights, in order to ensure they are second-class citizens. The Democrats are doing everything they possibly can to protect them.

-Not satisfied with that, the GOP has also said they are going after OUR Social Security and Medicare.

-This is just a partial list of hot topics this election year, as I sit here and sip my coffee this morning, and try for the life of me to figure out what could possibly motivate a Republican voter at this point.

-There's literally not a single thing to recommend the GOP to America. And EVERYTHING to recommend Democrats.
It is not even close.

-I'm proud to be a Democrat. DAMN proud.

-I look forward to helping demolish the GOP this year. It will be my pleasure, actually.  

-From Wisconsin with love, have a great day, Patriots!

1. ""Employment in the Golden State has fallen by 180,520 since June while its jobless rate has climbed to 5.1% from 4.1% a year ago. The national unemployment rate is 3.7% and even lower in Florida (3%), where employment has grown 111,433 over the last six months.""

2. ""The S&P 500 index closed last year 24% higher than the year before. Yet Californias personal income and corporate tax revenues in December were 3.3% and 21% lower, respectively.""

3. ""Meantime, the state has blown through tens of billions of dollars in federal pandemic largess, expanded Medicaid to undocumented immigrants, and approved new labor agreements with generous pay increases for government workers including prison guards. California spends $132,860 annually per prisoner, up 90% from a decade ago.""

4. ""Because government employee pensions are based on compensation at the end of their careers, pay increases inflate the states pension costs. Sacramentos required pension contribution for a highway-patrol officer now equals nearly 68% of compensation, meaning that this year the state must pay about $68,000 into the pension fund for an officer earning $100,000.""

5. ""As awful as the budget outlook is in Sacramento, it may be worse for cities across the state, which have few options other than to cut essential services or raise taxes. The city manager in Sacramento recently suggested patching a $50 million budget gap by taking longer to fix potholes and broken street lights.""

6. ""San Diego projects a $172 million budget shortfall. Without a new major ongoing revenue source, significant budget cuts to programs and services will be needed to address the citys structural budget deficit, a Dec. 5 budget report stated.""

7. ""Sales tax revenue is declining while federal pandemic aid has dried up. Although retail spending nationwide continues to grow faster than pre-pandemic levels, Californians have less money to spend at stores and restaurants because they are having to shell out more on gasoline, electricity and home and auto insurance. Blame the states progressive policies.""

8. ""Los Angeles City Administrator Matthew W. Szabo recently warned of a $400 million deficit owing to rising labor costs and lower-than-expected tax revenue.""

9. ""San Francisco faces a nearly $800 million deficit despite having imposed several new taxes in recent years, including one on the gross receipts of businesses whose highest-paid manager earns more than 100 times the median compensation of its San Francisco-based employees. This tax is layered on another new gross receipts tax on business revenue in San Francisco above $50 million and a tax on commercial rents. All these taxes punish businesses with offices and workers in the city, which is why so many, such as Charles Schwab, have said sayonara.""

10. ""Theres much ruin in a state, to adapt Adam Smith, and California seems intent on proving it. Regardless of whether Mr. Newsom fails up to the Oval Office, you can bet that California politicians will soon be importuning for another Washington rescue. The only certainties in California are death, taxes and bailouts.""

Hear me out: 

Weve recently been thinking more creatively about how ecommerce companies can utilize location-based push notifications  without even owning storefronts or having retail products. 

What Ive realized is that every area of the real world can be an advertising opportunity:

Imagine youre a DTC surfboard brand  you can set geofences around beaches to send notifications about online discounts to your customers while theyre on the beach. 

What about a running shoe business  you can create a geofence around the route of a marathon to send notifications to runners and spectators about your limited-time footwear offer online. 

How about a country music festival  southern apparel companies can set a geofence around the festival's coordinates to offer cash back on purchases of cowboy hats and boots during the festivals duration. 

You get the point? Every time your customers are in a high-traffic area that resonates with your business, you can utilize push notifications to bring their business online. 

And the easiest way to push these notifications to your most valuable customers  Wallet Passes. 

To me  thats next-level advertising.",5,0,17,950,6,['https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GGtludZXQAAQQog?format=jpg&name=small'],E-commerce,193,0.9558

1. Zomato's Expansion Plans:
   - Zomato plans to expand its 10-minute delivery platform, Blinkit.
   - It aims to add products from various categories.
2. Competing with E-commerce Giants:
   - Zomato's move puts it in direct competition with Amazon and Flipkart.
3. Building Supply Chain:
   - Zomato intends to build its supply chain to directly source products and manage stock.
4. Long-term Growth Driver:
   - The push into the direct-to-consumer (D2C) space is seen as a long-term growth driver.
5. Managing Product Flow:
   - Zomato plans to manage the flow of products for D2C brands, similar to marketplaces, without owning inventory directly.
6. Attempted Acquisition:
   - Zomato attempted to acquire and merge with e-commerce enabler Shiprocket at least twice but was declined.
7. Financial Performance:
   - Blinkit's gross order value (GOV) doubled to Rs 3,542 crore in Q3FY24, with a growth of 103% YoY.
   - Revenue from ads increased by 220% YoY during Q3FY24.
   - Zomato reported a net profit of Rs 138 crore and revenue of Rs 3,288 crore for October-December.
   - This marks the third consecutive quarter of positive earnings for Zomato.
8. CEO's Statement:
   - Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal believes Blinkit will be more valuable than the core business in the next decade.
   - Blinkit's GOV is close to Zomato's in some large cities, indicating its potential for shareholder value.

This expansion strategy into Blinkit and the D2C space reflects Zomato's efforts to diversify its business and tap into new revenue streams beyond its core food delivery service.",5,10,130,21.4K,18,[],E-commerce,257,0.9784

You can increase your sales by 50-200% within 6 months by utilizing this better

 Shopping ads - literally 80% of ecom Google ads sales come from these 

There is not enough talk about how to structure your shopping & PMAX campaigns into hero products campaigns, different categories campaigns, focus group campaigns etc etc.

I want to dive deeper into that, another time, but for now....

But where do you actually begin? No one really says...

Well now I do  here is how to set up your first shopping ads if you have never had any running and how to optimize to make them perform better week by week!

This is how to set it up from day one:

(LADS this is an incredibly long post I know, but it is also a god guide! So save it and follow it and you'll print cash)

 

Step 1. (You have no data, if you do have data then move on to step 2)

- You want to run PMAX campaigns ideally, but since you have no data you should preferably start with a normal shopping campaign to gather a base of data first

- Also you want to segment your campaigns into different focus areas

-> But as you have no data, we first need to figure out what these areas are going to be for us

So in step 1 we are going to create an ""all"" shopping campaign.

Why? Because by adding all products to begin with Google will compile all search pressures related to all our products

Google will try to get sales with all of our products 

But only succeed with some

When we see which products get the most impressions, best CTR, and the most sales > we know what our focus should be

Here is how to set up this first shopping campaign and what settings I suggest you to use:

(leave target ROAS blank to begin with!!!)

If youre an E-commerce owner, you need to try this with your store:

 When a customer clicks to sign up, take them through 2 extra steps.

Wont that cause drop-off? - Nope, Ive tested it - it doesnt

Ask for:

- Email (standard)
- Phone (standard)
- Whats your biggest goal right now? (additional)
- Whats most important when choosing product xx? (additional)

Then, run personalised welcome flows.

We see a 4% conversion boost when I do this with customers.

Heres what that looks like in $$$:

Say youre making $150k/mo through the welcome flow.

4% more is an extra $6k.

That might seem small, but - its 1 flow in 1 month.

Over 12 months, thats an extra $72k - not bad for an hours work.

Stop what youre doing, log into your shop, make the tweaks, do the same in your Klavio - BOOM, and enjoy your $72k bonus.

You can thank me later.",0,1,13,895,11,[],E-commerce,173,0.9697

This paper prompted me to delve deeper into why proper prompt engineering with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is crucial, especially at this stage of AI development. After reading other papers, I identified three conclusions that can enhance your prompts.

First: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is not a silver bullet

The paper Measuring Faithfulness in CoT Reasoning highlighted the inconsistent efficacy and fidelity of CoT reasoning, concluding that CoT is not universally superior to common prompts. Simply providing a structured prompt to ChatGPT will not necessarily yield better results than a conventional prompt. Without specific techniques, the results can vary significantly. Although the financial study did not share the exact prompts used, it mentioned techniques related to the following conclusions.

Second: Confirm the prompt contextualization (Inferential Bridging method)

Reading the paper Towards Faithful CoT with Inferential Bridging, despite its intimidating title, reveals that you need to provide hints of important information that the prompt should remember to reduce the risks of deviations or hallucinations.

Third: Calibrate the reasoning of your structured prompt

The paper Calibrating Reasoning in Language Models with Internal Consistency completes the puzzle on how to properly write well-structured and functional prompts using the CoT concept. The document extensively discusses how you should test each step of your prompt and calibrate it accordingly. While it may seem obvious, the normal practice is to run everything and check the results. The step-by-step compensatory system proves effective in checking the mechanics of your prompt.

I know it might sound complex, but here are three basic techniques on how to build an effective prompt:

- Procedural Approach: If you dont use a procedural approach, theres no guarantee that your highly structured prompt will be better than a normal one.

- Step-by-Step Testing: Test each step of your prompt before you just push an extensive prompt with several steps using CoT.

- Reinforce and Calibrate: During testing, you might need to reinforce important pieces of information or calibrate what is most important at each step.

We need everyone to come and support the team against Zambia on Friday. 

Its free entry. 5pm.

However, I entreat the Ministry of Sports & the GFA, to extend some level of respect and honour due this team. 

As I write, their qualification bonuses has been in arrears since September 2023. 

Theyve played six games (Rwanda, Benin & Namibia each home and away) and qualified ahead of ALL three teams but havent been paid a dime of their agreed bonuses. 

Their bonus was slashed from $6,000 per qualifier to $2,500. They accepted and went ahead to qualify but are still unpaid. 

Lets treat them with some respect. We cant pay one national team even before they kick a ball and for another, keep them waiting for months after theyve done their jobs creditably.

I gather athletes are expected to adhere *very* precisely to *very* strict anti-doping rules/protocols, lest they face serious repercussions: including providing detailed whereabouts, not missing tests, plus the inverted burden of proof -- if any banned substance is found in their sample, the athlete is guilty until proven innocent, etc.

I wonder if the doping/testing officials are also held to precise standards? And who monitors compliance? Who watches the watchers?

In the Valieva/Tutberitze case, the chain of custody/communication protocol of the sample seems murky. Supposedly the sample wasn't properly noted as ""expedited"" for an Olympian. And no one seems quite sure exactly when or how or to whom the lab results were first recorded or reported.

Shouldn't there be a detailed protocol/chain of custody document/record available for each sample which details the exact timeline of events for that sample? Including confirming correct testing device calibration?

These protocols probablly don't need to be default public, but in the case of a trail, they should def be available, and part of the trial record.

I worry a bit about athletes' rights in the sense that it seems athletes are held to very strict standards wrt doping/testing. Then they hand over a sample -- for which a positive test result could have devastating consequences for their entire career and livelihood. It seems like the doping officials then essentially say ""trust us"". Athletes deserve better.

I gather athletes are expected to adhere *very* precisely to *very* strict anti-doping rules/protocols, lest they face serious repercussions: including providing detailed whereabouts, not missing tests, plus the inverted burden of proof -- if any banned substance is found in their sample, the athlete is guilty until proven innocent, etc.

I wonder if the doping/testing officials are also held to precise standards? And who monitors compliance? Who watches the watchers?

In the Valieva/Tutberitze case, the chain of custody/communication protocol of the sample seems murky. Supposedly the sample wasn't properly noted as ""expedited"" for an Olympian. And no one seems quite sure exactly when or how or to whom the lab results were first recorded or reported.

Shouldn't there be a detailed protocol/chain of custody document/record available for each sample which details the exact timeline of events for that sample? Including confirming correct testing device calibration?

These protocols probablly don't need to be default public, but in the case of a trail, they should def be available, and part of the trial record.

I worry a bit about athletes' rights in the sense that it seems athletes are held to very strict standards wrt doping/testing. Then they hand over a sample -- for which a positive test result could have devastating consequences for their entire career and livelihood. It seems like the doping officials then essentially say ""trust us"". Athletes deserve better.

As most everyone here knows me... and knows that being in the US Military from 1986 through 2016. I was not stationed in San Antonio,  Houston, or even in the United States from 2010 through early 2016. 

Remember:
In January, the Taliban struck a deal to open an office in Qatar, a move toward peace talks that the United States saw as a crucial part of a political settlement to ensure a stable Afghanistan. But two months later, the Taliban suspended preliminary talks, accusing Washington of reneging on promises to take meaningful steps toward a prisoner swap. In February, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announces the Pentagons plan to conclude combat missions by as early as mid-2013 and shift to a primary security assistance role in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, several incidents served as blows to the international intelligence mission, I was deployed on.  Then an accidental burning of Qurans by U.S. troops and allegations that a U.S. soldier murdered at least sixteen Afghan villagers. Afghan President Karzai demanded that foreign troops be withdrawn from village outposts and confined to military bases, which analysts said would greatly accelerate the pace of transition from NATO to Afghan control. We had no internet connections, for smartphones, and even today Afghanistan's internet penetration rate stands at 18.4 percent of the total population at the start of 2023. Kepios analysis indicates that internet users in Afghanistan increased by 202 thousand (+2.7 percent) between 2022 and 2023.
Then, President Obama announces a timetable for withdrawing most U.S. forces from Afghanistan by the end of 2016. The first phase of his plan calls for 9,800 U.S. troops to remain after the combat mission concludes at the end of 2014, limited to training Afghan forces in intelligence and conducting operations against the remnants of al-Qaeda.
Mr. ROAD PAINTER is another hater. Look at his profile photo. Look at his posts... look at his comments,  about me. I don't care... however, a person living in Europe talking about ""nudist saunas,  shaft massages, and pregnancy massages.""
With another man three days ago, only to call me a homophobic or homophobe must be addressed.
Then claiming I was a porno lover ten years ago, because HE went back and found TWEETS from 2013.
When my account was hacked and I was deployed overseas. He is trying to embarrass me or discredit me in 2024.

As most everyone here knows me... and knows that being in the US Military from 1986 through 2016. I was not stationed in San Antonio,  Houston, or even in the United States from 2010 through early 2016. 

Remember:
In January, the Taliban struck a deal to open an office in Qatar, a move toward peace talks that the United States saw as a crucial part of a political settlement to ensure a stable Afghanistan. But two months later, the Taliban suspended preliminary talks, accusing Washington of reneging on promises to take meaningful steps toward a prisoner swap. In February, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announces the Pentagons plan to conclude combat missions by as early as mid-2013 and shift to a primary security assistance role in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, several incidents served as blows to the international intelligence mission, I was deployed on.  Then an accidental burning of Qurans by U.S. troops and allegations that a U.S. soldier murdered at least sixteen Afghan villagers. Afghan President Karzai demanded that foreign troops be withdrawn from village outposts and confined to military bases, which analysts said would greatly accelerate the pace of transition from NATO to Afghan control. We had no internet connections, for smartphones, and even today Afghanistan's internet penetration rate stands at 18.4 percent of the total population at the start of 2023. Kepios analysis indicates that internet users in Afghanistan increased by 202 thousand (+2.7 percent) between 2022 and 2023.
Then, President Obama announces a timetable for withdrawing most U.S. forces from Afghanistan by the end of 2016. The first phase of his plan calls for 9,800 U.S. troops to remain after the combat mission concludes at the end of 2014, limited to training Afghan forces in intelligence and conducting operations against the remnants of al-Qaeda.
Mr. ROAD PAINTER is another hater. Look at his profile photo. Look at his posts... look at his comments,  about me. I don't care... however, a person living in Europe talking about ""nudist saunas,  shaft massages, and pregnancy massages.""
With another man three days ago, only to call me a homophobic or homophobe must be addressed.
Then claiming I was a porno lover ten years ago, because HE went back and found TWEETS from 2013.
When my account was hacked and I was deployed overseas. He is trying to embarrass me or discredit me in 2024.

To do this, and in order to raise the maximum amount of money possible, it has partnered with the company Legends Internationals, an expert in the management of sports venues. 

The old stadium had 2,500 VIP seats and the new Spotify Camp Nou will have a total of 6,600, which can be expanded to 9,400 in Champions League matches and other important matches, such as the visit of Real Madrid. 

The most exclusive offer of the new Spotify Camp Nou will be twenty rooms called Very VIP Suites with a starting price of 27,000 euros. These exclusive rooms will have terraces with exterior views, a large interior space and twelve seats in the first VIP tier. In addition, 96 boxes will be set up in the second tier and VIP seats behind the bench area so that fans can see the players' exit onto the grass up close.

The club expects to earn 120 million euros per season in hospitality.

To do this, and in order to raise the maximum amount of money possible, it has partnered with the company Legends Internationals, an expert in the management of sports venues. 

The old stadium had 2,500 VIP seats and the new Spotify Camp Nou will have a total of 6,600, which can be expanded to 9,400 in Champions League matches and other important matches, such as the visit of Real Madrid. 

The most exclusive offer of the new Spotify Camp Nou will be twenty rooms called Very VIP Suites with a starting price of 27,000 euros. These exclusive rooms will have terraces with exterior views, a large interior space and twelve seats in the first VIP tier. In addition, 96 boxes will be set up in the second tier and VIP seats behind the bench area so that fans can see the players' exit onto the grass up close.

The club expects to earn 120 million euros per season in hospitality.

When the central bank INCREASES the exchange ($1:400 to $1: 600) it's a devaluation, opposite is a revaluation

(figures are examples)

Then CBN moved to a managed float (or dirty float) in a dirty float the currency is allowed to freely float but the central bank intervenes to keep it within a bank

So the CBN can say if Naira falls to $1:700, CBN will sell $ To BDC and buy Naira, thus forcing the exchange rate back to $1:N600

To maintain a fixed rate or even a managed float, you need reserves

The CBN reserves are not yet buoyant so it has introduced administrative actions to prop up the value of the naira e.g. Not allowing full repatriation of oil proceeds immediately 

All currencies are defended, the Swiss Franc is freely floated, and it's also convertible but the Swiss central bank intervenes in the open market to buy and sell currency to appreciate or depreciate the exchange rate of the Swiss franc

So in summary 

A pegged currency gives control but Is expensive, most gulf oil states peg their currency to the dollar 

A managed float is a hybrid between a freely floating currency and full peg. Central bank allows the currency to float but within guardrails 

A full float means the market sets exchange rates via price discovery but the Central Bank can intervene not by pegs but by buying and selling local or foreign currency on the free market to affect the exchange rate",17,119,346,33K,63,[],exchange rate,269,0.9505

- Microsoft laid off around 1,900 workers from a gaming group in January.

- The global video game industry is growing but barely, with 2023 game industry revenues up only 0.6% from 2022.

- Microsoft is struggling to find new players, with console games playing a significant portion of the market.

- I don't think we're doing a good enough job finding new players, Spencer said. Let's pick consoles as a good example: We found 200 million global households that will play console games. And that number really hasn't changed in the last five, six years.

- We've raised the price of games, he added, acknowledging the increasingly common $70 price point following nearly two decades of $60 games. We went through COVID. We found ways of getting more money per player. I think at some point you reach a peak on that, and, frankly, it can go to some places that are manipulative that I'm not a big fan of.

- The solution is to find new customers, and you find new customers through new ways of delivering games to players who can't play those games today, whether that's device, whether that's access, whether that's price point of video games.

- I have a commitment to the company on the Xbox business being a profitable and growing part of Microsoft, he said. And I need to put us in the best position for long-term growth. Most of that is about building great products that exceed their expectations and find millions of customers. But honestly, you know, the cost of building the products inclusive of the people who work on themI need to make sure we have enough of the right people and the right number of people in the right places for us to succeed.

- Revenue grew 61% in the last three months of 2023, largely due to the acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
 Without Activision Blizzard, gaming revenue grew 6%, but lower than other Microsoft divisions.

- Microsoft's job eliminations from its gaming teams were unexpected, including at least one full game project shutdown at Blizzard.

- The cuts were a combination of looking across the full portfolio and areas of alignment between Activision, ZeniMax, and Xbox

- He also noted that, since the acquisition of the ZeniMax family of studios three years ago, the organization added about 15,000 people to its business.",6,17,150,17K,14,['https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GG0NrqeaEAAROLd?format=jpg&name=small'],Microsoft,404,0.9925

I would think a naked drunk ""migrant,"" which I take to mean illegal-migrant, attacking an Amazon driver would be weird enough.  Alas, this happened in NYC, so you know there is more to it.

Evidently, drunk naked-migrant was upset that his public masturbation session was discovered, yes you read that correctly.  So he takes off running at Amazon man, and well, it's best to let Amazon man tell this part of the story: ""So what I did was I looked towards the floor and I saw a big snow  pile...I picked up a piece and I socked him with it and he went down on his butt.""

But it gets weirder.  Amazon man sees some cops and calls them over.  After talking to both, the cops arrest Amazon man because everyone knows drunk naked ""migrants"" who masturbate in public come here for a better life and would not tell an untruth.

Think about that.

If you bought 8 years ago and moved your coins to a new hardware wallet 4 years ago, I'm not talking about those coins. Coins that have been dormant on the blockchain for over 7 years.

Put differently, almost 21% of the circulating supply has not moved to change hardware wallets, addresses, be sold, etc. in over 7 years.

Likely most of these coins are lost forever.

When you factor in lost coins that are younger than 7 years, it's feasible to estimate that around 5 million BTC (or more) are lost.

As Satoshi Nakamoto said, Lost coins only make everyone elses coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.

The supply cap for Bitcoin is 21 million but the actual circulating, in use supply, may only be 13-15 million over the next century as you factor in lost coins.

This approach uses language models to predict protein structures, pushing the boundaries of protein design and folding. Despite challenges, this research highlights  the commitment to advancing the field.

Machine learning models play a crucial role in protein design, categorized into sequence-based, sequence-label, and structure-based models. These models enable scientists to design new proteins and optimize their structures, which is crucial for drug discovery and medical research.

Practical applications and tools
DIProT, an interactive protein design toolkit, exemplifies the practical application of AI in solving the protein inverse folding problem. By leveraging deep learning, DIProT demonstrates competitive performance, showcasing the potential of AI in revolutionizing protein design.

The announcement of AlphaFold2 marked a turning point in computational methods for predicting protein structure from sequence data. This milestone, combined with advances in AI, signals a shift in protein design. The industry anticipates an AlphaFold moment for functional protein engineering, aiming to create functional proteins on demand.

The future of protein design
The integration of AI with protein design is set to transform biotechnology and medicine significantly. The ability to design proteins from scratch heralds a new era of possibilities in drug development, enzyme design, and vaccine creation. As this field advances, the promise of AI and protein design continues to offer new solutions and hope for the future of global health.

Artificial intelligence is not just a tool but a catalyst for innovation in biotechnology and medicine. By advancing protein design, AI opens up unprecedented possibilities for the development of new treatments and solutions.

According to Hindu philosophy, 

our senses are  constantly fed information that shapes our understanding of reality, 

but  this reality is just an intricate play of divine forces, masking the  ultimate truth of existence.

Just like waking up from a dream or exiting a VR game, 

the true spiritual journey is to see beyond Maya's illusion

If you could submerse yourself into a full sensory virtual reality and live any sort of life with no limit -  at first we would be rich, we'd be kings, queens, superheroes. Live out fantastic space operas, rom-coms, meet our soulmates, immerse ourselves into all pleasurable experiences our mind could imagine. 
After a while, experiences filled with only pleasure would get a bit boring, you'd want to switch it up. Dive into some experiences laced with drama. Experiences that provoke danger, excitement. Experience that make you say ""whew that was a close one, wasn't it?"". You go into games like Call of Duty, Cyberpunk, GTA, movies like Mission Impossible, Avengers. Dramatic movies, maybe even thrillers. Experiences where you have to put effort into them to win. 
But there would still be the knowing you were in a game, that you weren't really playing like your life depended on it. 
Eventually you'd want a bit of randomness, to roll the dice. 
You'd start having experiences where you allow yourself to forget you're in VR. To increase the steaks, to increase the immersion. 
You'd roll the dice much more, let randomness of circumstance play a part in your experience. 
Eventually, with enough rolls of those dice, you'd end up where you are right now, in this very moment, in this very life.

I like this experiment because it let's me play into the idea that this life I'm living now, with all its wonders and hardships - might be the very thing a being with infinite amounts of power at their fingertips want to experience. Immersion. Pleasure. Pain. Heartbreak. Love. Fear. Hope. Not knowing who, or where I am. Just being. A god's dream.",0,0,4,298,1,[],virtual reality,297,0.9621

Greetings! Most of what we hear on  about Teslas driving themselves is Full Self Driving (FSD) Beta, but I thought Id share a few thoughts from someone new to the Tesla environment who only has Autopilot (names I dont like, but I already put that in a post).

Having driven a Tesla just under 2 weeks now, I have experimented a few times with Autopilot and here are some observations:

1. It does what it does very well - it follows the lanes, stays in traffic and controls speed well.
2. This feature would be excellent on a long highway drive.
3. You need to remember that it does NOT change lanes (unless you have Advanced Autopilot).
4. If you manually change lanes, it appears that overrides the Autosteer functionality, but does not disable Traffic Aware Cruise Control.
5. It seems like the way to turn off Traffic Aware Cruise Control is to tap the regular brake. My opinion, this transition is awkward and can be dangerous if misunderstood.

I suspect many of the issues that have been reported over time with Teslas behaving badly (running into stopped vehicles, etc) were likely related to people trying to use 1 pedal driving after they had engaged Traffic Aware Cruise Control and the car did not slow down when they expected it to.

I say this because I love 1 pedal driving and remembering to hit that brake pedal to regain control of speed after a TACC session is not at all intuitive. I have not been close to hitting anything, but definitely had to figure out how to slow down a few times.

Just a few thoughts from a newbie here. Please correct anything I got wrong or add your own observations in replies!",3,0,8,351,0,[],autopilot,298,0.9247

Art blends in with life

Enjoy life

Let's go
Lets experience Chinese traditional culture
Have a sip of hot tea
Lets go 

Teacher, we want to come here today mainly to learn about our tea culture
Including learning about tea sets and just traditional tea culture 
Thats why we came to you to learn more about that

To get started, we can also drink an aged white tea.
I can tell that the difference between them is the appearance.
Just the young leaves and the old leaves
This should be it
This is one of the main points 
There is a saying that says that 
white tea is
One year of tea, three years of medicine, seven years of treasure

How many years are we drinking today?

14 years
You can count how many years this has been
Nine years
Almost ten years
Lets drink treasure
Pour it out first
You can see that its color is different
This color will be very dark

Nine years:
This is what it looks like in a year or two
This is what it looks like in nine years
After being stored
Obviously the color will change
The aroma and taste will change

The porcelain in front of me today
It is also closely related to the""Song"" Dynasty

The first of the five famous kilns in the Song Dynasty
Ruci porcelain

The imperial Ruguan porcelain used by Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty
Azure
In ancient times, only the emperor could use it.
How come can we use it now?
At that time, after the Jin invasion
And the demise of the Northern Song Dynasty
All the porcelain at the kiln entrance was blown up.
This piece of porcelain only survived for 20 years in the Song Dynasty.
Then it was not being used for nearly a thousand years
Until 1953
Premier Zhou Enlai issued an order to restore this traditional culture
Another ten years had passed until 1988
Only then had the azure glaze of the porcelain been truly restored.
If you touch Ruci porcelain, you will feel it is very moist.

""Like jade but not jade is better than jade""
Because it has agate glaze
Very moist
Look at this glaze
Why does it have this change in taste?
It's because of Ruci
It has been recorded since ancient times
There is another saying that says that

""If you eat a good meal, it won't go rancid for three days.""

Such an effect

Tea leaves are highly collectible

Right

So what exactly do they taste like when you drink them (the difference)

Here are four samples in front of us
They are actually the most common varieties of white tea we have.
The four varieties of tea plants are different.
(Pekoe Silver Needle, Yu Peony, Shoumei)
The three of them are born from the same tree, just different parts of the tree 
The tea is clear
(Gongmei)
Itself is on the same tree
There is an essential difference between them
The difference between the three of them are in harvest time and which parts of the tree to pick from
So their appearances are different
Silver needles happen with the first wave of spring harvest
Then followed by
Shoumei can be harvested in the spring and autumn
70% of white tea production is Shoumei
Bai Hao Yin Zhen is relatively speaking  have the least in availability and the scarcest
There are tea leaves on one branch, but the buds are pointed, and just a few buds
Right
We drink the tea
Have you ever used a filter?
Never drank white tea

Vellus-nitrogen acid
Because these vellus hairs are all amino acids
All are beneficial ingredients
Can you see inside?
Floating floc
But if you look at it there is nothing there
It's not muddy at all

But actually I think
This tastes stronger than that (nine-year-old) scent.

As time goes by, the moisture level will grow.

Yeah

I can tell you a bit of knowledge about popular science.
Why is tea bitter?

Bitter-caffeine
Why is it sour?

Astringent-tea polyphenols
Why is it fresh",1,3,15,680,2,['https://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1741010702968758272/img/_3QzN-XmPyusCcoA.jpg'],Chinese traditional culture,690,0.9894

DRAGONS EXISTED

CONFIRMED BY ZETATALK

ZetaTalk: Dragons, written Jul 15, 1995

Mankind has many myths about dragons throughout the world. In the Orient the dragon is featured on pottery and in parades, and European myths are replete with Knights in armor going into battle against firebreathing dragons. The dragons invariable have wings and are shaped suspiciously like dinosaurs. Is there some basis in fact for this common human memory? Indeed there is. Where the dinosaurs died out long before mankind was engineered into being from ape stock, the Earth was not the only planet to give birth to such creatures. Evolution follows similar patterns, and where your Earth brought forth dinosaurs with wings, just so did other planets compatible with the Earth.

Your dragons were transplants brought to the Earth by early ambassadors from the Service-to-Self, who anticipated an increased harvest of lackeys from the Earth due to the fear and despair their dragons wrought. Were the dragons intelligent and incarnated with souls? No. On a scale of 1 to 10, where the average dog is a 10, a dragon was barely a 3. This is why, in spite of the massive size and capacity to fly as well as lumber over hill and dale, they were so easily slain. Dumb brutes. Hundreds were brought to Earth, and released on terrified villages. The dragons ate humans, which were neither swift runners or able to barricade themselves in their mud huts, and were a tastier morsel than the deer, which ran fast and had taut, lean muscles.

The legends speak of sacrifices, where humans would periodically offer one of their own to placate the dragon. Well, of course this reduced the rampages, as dinner had been brought to the door. Where some dragons mated, they were scattered to begin with and, dying without progeny, eventually disappeared from the Earth. There were perhaps a few hundred delivered, and their reign, ending only in the last Millennia, lasted for thousands of years. The stories of dragons, all the more impressive as they were true, spread more widely than the dragons themselves. Did they breathe fire? No. But when roaring, open mouthed, it felt like that to those within range. Hot breath and a big windpipe.

Confucianism: Founded by Confucius (Kong Fuzi), this school emphasized morality, proper social relationships, justice, and sincerity. Confucianism became the dominant ideology in later Chinese history, particularly during the Han Dynasty.

Daoism (Taoism): Laozi and Zhuangzi are the most notable figures in Daoism. This philosophy advocates for a life in harmony with the Dao (Way), emphasizing naturalness, simplicity, and non-action (wu-wei).

Legalism: Focused on strict laws and harsh punishments, Legalists like Han Fei and Li Si believed that strong, authoritarian governance was the key to social order. Legalism became influential during the Qin Dynasty.

Mohism: Founded by Mozi, Mohism promoted universal love, meritocracy, and pacifism, challenging the hierarchical and ritualistic norms of Confucianism.

School of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements: This school combined cosmology and philosophy, influencing Chinese medicine, divination, and Feng Shui.

School of Names (Logicians): Philosophers like Gongsun Long and Hui Shi focused on logic, paradoxes, and the nature of language and reality.

Agrarianism: Advocated returning to an agrarian society where communal land ownership and agricultural self-sufficiency were emphasized.

Military Strategists: This group, including Sun Tzu, author of ""The Art of War,"" focused on tactics and strategy, reflecting the era's pervasive warfare.",1,4,17,321,2,[],Confucianism,207,0.9758

Prompt: A close up view of a glass sphere that has a zen garden within it. There is a small dwarf in the sphere who is raking the zen garden and creating patterns in the sand.

Harappan architecture was very different and unique, when compared with any other civilizations of the time and shows certain elements which later civilizations of the Indian civilization borrowed from.

The architecture of the Harappan Civilization was very unique and had no foreign influences. The use of the architecture was mostly for the purpose of functions and not for beauty or decoration. The evolution of the architecture of the civilization occurs in isolation and has been influenced by the local cultures; which prevailed previously years back of the first farming and pastoralist settlements. The maturity and elegance which is present in the architecture of the Harappan civilization is unique and no other civilization can match its level of complexity and style.

The main prespective behind the architecture of Harappan Civilization is that of utilitarian. They were also one of the first to introduce separate workers quaters. The cities in Harappan civilization didnt have same town designs but most of the buildings followed a similar pattern. Most of the building structures included defensive wall, citadel and lower town, as well as alleys and roadways, drainage and water management systems. The plan of the city was created by use of geometrcial tools and followed a certain pattern, citadel being located in the west of lower town, however in some cities it was located in south. Cardinal directions of streets and lanes were used for partitioning certain rural villages to some blocks and sub-blocks and the residences were mostly lined up on both the sides of the streets. 

The streets and roadways were all straight mostly and intersected at the right angle. All roadways were constructed with burned bricks, with the lenght of each of brick being four times its height and also breadth being two times its height. The city was split into rectangular blocks by streets and also roadways. There were also evidences of trash cans.

The archaeological site of Harappa was heavily damaged under British and French rule, when bricks from the ruins were used as track ballast in the construction of the Lahore-Multan Railway. The current village of Harappa is less than 1km from the ancient site. In 2005, a controversial amusement park scheme at the site was abandoned when builders unearthed many archaeological artefacts during the early stages of building work.",5,305,1.5K,58.9K,108,['https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GGEusYzXUAQQHH7?format=jpg&name=900x900'],ancient architecture,401,-0.9088

Ramesses II (1304-1214 BC), also known as Ramesses the Great, left a profound impact on ancient Egyptian architecture and culture. 

Ramesses II commissioned numerous monumental building projects, including grand temples and colossal statues. One of the most famous examples is the Ramesseum, his mortuary temple located on the west bank of the Nile in Thebes (modern-day Luxor). The temple showcased his power and divine status, with intricate reliefs and massive statues of the pharaoh. His construction projects also extended to other cities and religious sites across Egypt.

Ramesses II is particularly renowned for his temple complex at Abu Simbel. Carved into the cliffs along the Nile, these temples were dedicated to the gods Amun-Ra, Ra-Horakhty, and Ptah, as well as to Ramesses himself. The Great Temple of Abu Simbel features four colossal statues of Ramesses II on its facade, showcasing his dominance and divine connection.

Ramesses II's reign witnessed an artistic revival characterized by intricate and detailed relief carvings. These carvings adorned the walls of temples and tombs, depicting scenes from religious rituals, military campaigns, and everyday life. The carvings often portrayed Ramesses II in a larger-than-life manner, emphasizing his authority and achievements.

Ramesses II developed a cult of personality, promoting himself as a mighty ruler and a living god. He used art, architecture, and monumental structures to enhance his image and solidify his position as a powerful deity on Earth. This cult of personality contributed to the overall cultural ethos of ancient Egypt during his reign.

Ramesses II's architectural and cultural achievements had a lasting impact on subsequent Egyptian dynasties. His building projects and artistic style influenced later pharaohs, who sought to emulate his grandeur and establish their own divine connections. The artistic and architectural legacy of Ramesses II continues to inspire and fascinate historians, archaeologists, and tourists to this day.

Ramesses II's reign marked a period of architectural and cultural flourishing in ancient Egypt, leaving behind a rich legacy that showcases the grandeur and artistic prowess of the time.",32,302,1.3K,92.8K,114,['https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GGhVlldW4AAYK7j?format=jpg&name=small'],ancient architecture,341,0.9959

Regarding the reason for appearing in 'Wonderful World', Cha Eunwoo said, ""I was first drawn to the pain and wounds of 'Kwon Seonyul',"" and ""I wanted to heal the deep wounds in my heart, overcome them, and act as a person who changes."" He revealed the reason why he took on the challenge of changing his acting skills.

In reality, Cha Eunwoo is about to break away from his romantic image and friendly, sweet appearance and transform into a servant who handles rough things in the dark, something he has never shown before. Regarding this, Cha Eunwoo said, ""Kwon Seonyul is a rough and dark person, but he is a friend who plans his life carefully. The character's unique atmosphere that permeates his rough life is attractive. You will be able to see a different side of him than before."" He continued, ""Personally, I liked Seonyul's honest and unaffected side, so I wanted to express this well. Therefore, I relaxed as much as possible and acted with sincerity. I also paid the most attention to portraying emotions. After reading the script, I realized Seonyul's emotions. I think I went to the set while constantly thinking about my feelings. There were a lot of scenes where I had to keep the flow and direction of emotions going, so I didnt let go of my nerves while filming, he said, adding that Cha Eunwoo is looking forward to the new things he will show through Wonderful World.",0,5,19,522,5,"['https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GG5a-YDaYAAFBo1?format=jpg&name=small', 'https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GG5a-a1asAAfOa9?format=jpg&name=360x360', 'https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GG5a-eRbsAAvinm?format=jpg&name=360x360', 'https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GG5a-hLbsAAH5GL?format=jpg&name=360x360']",drama,266,0.9906

Interestingly, the Ides of March originally had a non-threatening history. Kalends, Nones, and Ides were ancient markers used to reference dates in relation to lunar phases. Ides simply referred to the first full moon of a given month, which usually fell between the 13th and 15th. In fact, the Ides of March once signified the new year, which meant celebrations and rejoicing.

So, while the Ides of March may have a dark reputation due to Caesar's assassination, its origins are more mundane and even celebratory.",1,4,17,"1,314",1,['https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GG5OCdcWsAAQM0q?format=jpg&name=small'],Shakespeare,139,0.5423

We have an update from Ngezi community fight to protect their land. 

We have an in-depth report from a human rights investigative mission to Glen View 3 where people are living in raw sewage. We hear from a former inmate at Chikurubi Maximum Security Prison about the deplorable human rights situation for inmates. 

And our Manifesto is unstoppable. Now available in Shona and Ndebele. In our blog section, our Community Engagement Specialist Gillian, reflects on the fate of the Manifesto in the face of the parliamentary recalls.
