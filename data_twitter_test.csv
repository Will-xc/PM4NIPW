2. Banking Sector
Despite a significant decrease from the previous year's $2,089.60 million, the Banking sector, which serves as the foundation of Nigeria's financial system, still managed to attract $832.64 million.

3. Financing Sector
With a substantial investment of $445.94 million, the Financing sector continued to play a vital role in supporting economic growth, despite experiencing a decrease from $791.16 million in 2022.

4. Shares
The Stocks industry saw an inflow of $294.08 million, down from $469.42 million in 2022, suggesting that investors are adopting a careful stance, possibly awaiting more conducive market conditions before engaging to equity investments in Nigerian companies.

One thing we have to remember is that all government spending is taxpayer spending, and in my personal opinion, we should hold our government to account for every penny. But to start when there is injury and harm to Canadians, because of government action, might not be a reasonable line. 

We see outrageous and unaccounted for public spending for broken services and programs.

We need everyone to come and support the team against Zambia on Friday. 

Its free entry. 5pm.

However, I entreat the Ministry of Sports & the GFA, to extend some level of respect and honour due this team. 

As I write, their qualification bonuses has been in arrears since September 2023. 

Theyve played six games (Rwanda, Benin & Namibia each home and away) and qualified ahead of ALL three teams but havent been paid a dime of their agreed bonuses. 

Their bonus was slashed from $6,000 per qualifier to $2,500. They accepted and went ahead to qualify but are still unpaid. 

Lets treat them with some respect. We cant pay one national team even before they kick a ball and for another, keep them waiting for months after theyve done their jobs creditably.

On the positive side, it has led to advancements in medical treatments, diagnostics, and improved healthcare delivery. Telemedicine, wearable devices, and health apps enhance accessibility and monitoring. However, excessive screen time, sedentary behavior, and digital stress can contribute to health issues. Striking a balance, using technology responsibly, and being mindful of its effects are crucial for maintaining overall well-being in the digital age.
And 
On negative side 
Excessive use of technology can contribute to various negative health impacts. Prolonged screen time may lead to eye strain, disrupted sleep patterns, and sedentary behavior, contributing to issues like obesity. Social media use can affect mental health, causing anxiety, depression, and a sense of inadequacy.

Buy toys, make Mid-Autumn lanterns

According to ancient Vietnamese customs, every Mid-Autumn Festival night, people in the village organize together to make lanterns, lion dances,... very fun. These days, when the Mid-Autumn Festival has become familiar and become a spiritual dish for Vietnamese people, especially for children, the most meaningful thing you can do for your children is to buy toys for them. Make your own Mid-Autumn lanterns or take them out to enjoy the full moon festival, watch lion dances, etc. On this occasion, let the children have the opportunity to enjoy carrying lanterns, sing, entertain, and eat candies freely. instead of being limited to weekdays.
Tell the story of the Mid-Autumn Festival
